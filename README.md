# Customer-Segmentation-with-SQL

## Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation based on transactional and demographic data using SQL queries. Customer segmentation helps businesses categorize their customers into distinct groups based on various characteristics, such as purchasing behavior, demographics, and spending patterns, which allows for more targeted marketing strategies.

## Features
Data Extraction: Pull customer data from transactional databases.
Segmentation Criteria: Implemented segmentation based on:
Purchase frequency
Average transaction value
Demographics (age, gender, location)
Customer lifetime value (CLV)

## Data Analysis
SQL Queries: Structured SQL queries are used to create segments and generate insights.

### Using RFM Analysis: 
- RFM is a data modeling method used to analyze customer value.
- It stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary which are the three metrics that describe the customers.
- It is an indexing technique that uses past purchase behavior to segment customers.

After Customer Segmentation and Products Grouping using SQL, We will be having different segments of customers and groups of sold together products. So our aim is to bring back Customers and increase sales of brought together Products. I will be providing general business solutions for retail sales along with our Vehicle Product Sales in data.

## Insights & Recommendation:
- Add Combo Offers to such products.
- Set Remainder in Customers Profile, In case they miss to purchase their brought together products.
- Assign Sales Support Persons with good knowledge about that product in that brought together section to guide the customers.
- Arrange such products Closer.
- Show them other Replacement Options by other companies.
- Provide such items near Billing Sections, so that they can remember easily.
